         * Simple script in YAML.
         *
         * DumbScripts have no flow control and they are composed from a sequence
         * of simple instructions. They are started when the entity is created.
         *
         * The script is composed from pairs of instructions with their parameters.
         *
         * Example:
         * --------------------
         * !!pairs
         * - for 0.25:
         *     move-direction: 0.5
         * - for 0.5:
         *     move-direction: -0.5
         *     move-speed: 0.5
         * - for 0.5:
         *     fire: [0, 1]
         * - die:
         * --------------------
         * 
         *
         * Current DumbScript instructions:
         *
         * for time:
         *
         * Example:
         * --------------------
         * - for 1.0:   #For duration of one second
         *     move-direction: 0.5 #move in direction of 0.5 radians relative to current rotation
         *     move-speed: 0.5     #move at 50% speed
         *     fire [0, 2]         #fire weapons 0 and 2
         * --------------------
         * 
         * Perform an action for specified time (in seconds):
         * 
         * Params:
         *     move-direction = Move in direction specified in radians relative to current
         *                      direction.
         *     move-speed     = Movement speed relative to max speed. Must be >= -1 and <= 1 . 
         *     fire           = Fire weapons specified in the sequence. As there are only
         *                      256 weapon slots, the values must be between >= 0 and  <= 255 .
         * 
         * die:
         *
         * Example:
         * --------------------
         * - die: #Kill the entity.
         * --------------------
         *
         * Kill the entity. Any instructions after this are not executed.
