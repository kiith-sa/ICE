General:
    Clear names for everything, as few words as needed but no fewer.

Classes:
    Document what an instance represents, invariants.
    Document immutability of classes.

Functions:
    Preconditions, postconditions, side effects, format of passed parameters ,
    esp. strings and what they represent), what we can and can't do
    with passed or returned instance 
    (do we have to call a specific method to delete instance produced by this call?
     will changing this instance we passed result in error?)
    units of parameters (pixels, world units, which space this coordinate is in...)
    when they can or can't be called
    Principle of least astonishment - functions should do what user expects 
    (from the function name) - without significant unexpected side effects.
