Installing from source on Linux
===============================

-----------------------------------
Using DMD (Digital Mars D Compiler)
-----------------------------------


1. Install DMD dependencies

   DMD depends on ``gcc-multilib``.
   On Debian/Ubuntu, you can install it with::

      sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib


2. Download and install DMD

   Get the newest DMD 2 binary package for your distro from
   `here <http://dlang.org/download.html>`_, and install it.

   
3. Install ICE dependencies

   ICE needs SDL 1.2, SDL-Mixer, Vorbis and FreeType to run, so install them 
   with your package manager. It's possible that you already have them, as many
   projects depend on them. On Debian/Ubuntu::
   
      sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2debian libfreetype6 libsdl-mixer1.2 libvorbis0a


4. Get ICE 

   You can download and extract ICE source tarball from its 
   `GitHub page <https://github.com/kiith-sa/ICE>`_.
   
   Or you can download the source repository using git::
   
      git clone git://github.com/kiith-sa/ICE.git


5. Compile and install ICE

   Move to to the directory where you downloaded ICE source (this is the 
   directory that contains the ``cdc.d`` file).
   
   First, compile the CDC build script::
   
       dmd cdc.d
   
   Now, you need to compile ICE::
   
       ./cdc
    
   This will compile a debug build. A release build can be compiled as well.
   For more info about ICE build targets, type ``./cdc --help``.
   
   Now you can install ICE::
   
       sudo ./install.sh
   
   The release build will be copied to ``/usr/bin/ice.bin`` and a launcher 
   script to ``/usr/bin/ice`` so you can now launch ICE by typing ``ice``
   into the console. Game data files will be copied to ``usr/local/share/ice``.
   ICE will store user settings and similar data in 
   ``/home/YOUR_USER_NAME/.ice``.
