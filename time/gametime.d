/**
 * Handles timing of game updates.
 *
 * GameTime ensures that all game logic/physics/etc updates happen with a 
 * constant tick, and asynchronously relative to game renders, while renders
 * can happen whenever time is available.
 *
 * For example, if renders are slow, one render might be followed by multiple 
 * game updates to cover time taken by the render. If they are fast, multple 
 * renders might happen between game updates.
 *
 * If game updates get too slow, they slow down while the game tick length
 * is preserved, resulting in a gameplay slowdown.
