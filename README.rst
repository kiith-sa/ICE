ICE

------------
Introduction
------------

ICE is a top-down scrolling shooter in tradition of Raptor and Tyrian with 
vector style graphics written in the D programming language.

ICE is in early development and there is no release at this time.

--------
Gameplay
--------

You move your ship around the screen while shooting enemies that attack you.
A basic weapon allows you to shoot forward while, over the course of the 
campaign, you get more weapons that can be used only once in a while,
taking time to recharge (currently, these are always enabled).

^^^^^^^^^^^^
Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

ICE is written in D2, so it requires a working D2 compiler such as DMD or GDC.
It also depends on Derelict, D:GameVFS and D:YAML, which are included for 
convenience. SDL 1.2, FreeType and OpenGL are required through Derelict.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Compiling/Installing on Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, ensure you have all dependencies, as specified above, installed.

ICE uses a D script, ``cdc.d`` for compilation. In order to compile, you first 
have to compile ``cdc.d`` by typing following commands, for dmd an gdc 
respectively::

   dmd cdc.d 

   gdc cdc.d -o cdc 


To compile ICE, use the following command, which will build the debug target.
This should take about a minute with dmd, or a few minutes with gdc::
    
   ./cdc

Alternatively, you can consult ``cdc --help`` for specific build targets - 
you need the release target if you want to install using the install.sh script.

If you don't want to install, you can run ICE from the package's top
level directory by launching ``./ice-debug`` binary or binary of any
other build target.

To install, run following command as root (e.g. by using ``sudo``)::

   ./install.sh

This will copy the release binary to ``/usr/bin/ice.bin`` , and a simple
launcher script to ``/usr/bin/ice``. Main game data will be copied
to ``/usr/local/share/ice`` and ICE will create a ``.ice/`` subdirectory in
your home directory.
