<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To simplify its development and to make its engine reusable, ICE is designed to
be as moddable as possible. All entities in the game are loaded from human
readable YAML files. Graphics and &#8220;scripts&#8221; are also loaded from YAML, although
different formats might be supported in future.</p>
<div class="section" id="about-the-directory-structure">
<h3>About the directory structure<a class="headerlink" href="#about-the-directory-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ICE has a modular directory system to allow for pluggable mods in future,
howevever, this feature is not used at the moment.</p>
<p>For now, there is only one &#8220;mod&#8221; - ICE itself. This mod can be found in the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">data/main</span></tt> directory. These are main game data - they are not supposed to be
changed after installation. Any file in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">data/main</span></tt> can be overridden by a
file in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">user_data/main</span></tt> with the same filename.</p>
<p>Note that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">user_data/main</span></tt> translates to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.ice/main</span></tt> after installation on
Linux and similar systems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-ship">
<h2>Creating a ship<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-ship" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ships are stored in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ships</span></tt> subdirectory of a mod directory. For the main
game, that is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">data/main/ships</span></tt>. Note that this is a convention - ships could
be stored elsewhere if needed.</p>
<p>In terms of ICE, a ship is an <em>entity</em> - a collection of <em>components</em> that
specify properties to the ship. For example, a ship might have a <em>visual</em>
component - which describes how it is drawn on screen.</p>
<p>To create your own ship, you can create a file with the contents of the
following example in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ships</span></tt> directory.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can try copying and modifying any ship that already exists
there.</p>
<p>Example ship:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>visual: visual/player.yaml
engine:
  maxSpeed: 300
  acceleration: 2100  #-1 is instant
volume:
  aabbox:
    min: [-32, -32]
    max: [32,  0]
weapon:
  0: weapons/default.yaml
collidable:
health: 500
warhead:
  damage: 10
  killsEntity: false</pre>
</div>
<p>Each entry in the ship code describes a component and the properties of that
component. This ship has the following components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A <em>visual</em> component, pointing to the graphics file for the ship.</li>
<li>An <em>engine</em> component that can move the ship at most 300 units per second and
accelerate at 2100 units per second per second.</li>
<li>A <em>volume</em> used for collision detection (for example with projectiles).
This volume is an <em>aabbox</em> - axis-aligned-bounding-box, or a rectangle that does
not rotate.</li>
<li>A <em>weapon</em> component with one weapon at slot <em>0</em>. There are multiple (256)
weapon slots to allow a ship to have more than one weapon.</li>
<li>A <em>collidable</em> component that s just that - it allows the ship to receive
collisions. Most projectiles, for example, have a volume but are not
collidable - they can&#8217;t collide with each other, only with the <em>collidable</em>
ships.</li>
<li>A <em>health</em> component with 500 maximum health. Entities with a health component
die when they run out of health.</li>
<li>A <em>warhead</em> component that causes 10 damage and doesn&#8217;t kill the ship itself.
Warheads are fired at collision with another entity. This means our ship
causes damage to other ships it collides with and doesn&#8217;t immediately get
destroyed. Most projectiles, for example, are destroyed as soon as they
collide with something.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, a ship needs other resources - In this example, a visual component
and any weapons it may use. Those are explained below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-graphics-visual-component">
<h2>Creating graphics (visual component)<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-graphics-visual-component" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Currently the only graphics format supported by ICE is a simple YAML based
vector format that only supports straight lines, with variable colors and line
widths.</p>
<p>Graphics are specified by <em>visual components</em>, defined in YAML files in the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">visual</span></tt> subdirectory of a mod directory.</p>
<p>To create your own visual component, you can create a file with the contents of
the following example in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">visual</span></tt> directory.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can try copying and modifying any visual component that
already exists there.</p>
<p>Example visual component:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>type: lines
vertices:
  !!pairs
  - width: 2
  - color:  rgba40400000
  - vertex: [-7.0, -4.0]
  - color:  rgbA0A0FF
  - vertex: [-1.0, 12.0]

  - vertex: [1.0,  12.0]
  - color:  rgba40400000
  - vertex: [7.0,  -4.0]

  - color:  rgbA0A0FF
  - vertex: [0.0,  8.0]
  - color:  rgba40400000
  - vertex: [0.0,  13.0]</pre>
</div>
<p>This visual component is an array of <em>lines</em>, which is currently the only
supported visual component <em>type</em>.</p>
<p>Lines are specified by <em>vertices</em>, a sequence of pairs that can either specify
line <em>width</em>, vertex <em>color</em> and <em>vertex</em> itself.</p>
<p>Lines are formed by the 1st and 2nd vertex, the 3rd and 4rd, and so on.
The number of vertices must be divisible by 2.</p>
<p>A <em>color</em> or <em>width</em> entry affects all vertices drawn after it, until the next
<em>color</em> or <em>width</em> entry. Default color is white and default width is 1.</p>
<p>Note that <em>width</em> affects only whole lines, while <em>color</em> can change colors of
each vertex (which blend in the line, so you can e.g. have a line that blends
from a red end to a blue end).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-weapon">
<h2>Creating a weapon<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-weapon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Weapons are stored in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">weapons</span></tt> subdirectory of the mod directory. A
weapon fires <em>projectiles</em> (entities) in <em>bursts</em> of one or more projectiles.
Each burst takes time to be fired and consumes 1 unit of ammo (which may be
finite or infinite). When a weapon runs out of ammo, it can&#8217;t fire for a
specified <em>reload</em> period.</p>
<p>To create a new weapon, you can create a file with the contents of the
following example in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">weapons</span></tt> directory.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can try copying and modifying any weapon that already exists
there.</p>
<p>Example weapon:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>burstPeriod: 0.06
ammo: 2
reloadTime: 0.2
burst:
  - projectile: projectiles/defaultbullet.yaml
    delay: 0.02
    position: [8.0, 8.0]
    direction: -0.1
  - projectile: projectiles/defaultbullet.yaml
    delay: 0.0
    position: [0.0, -8.0]
    direction: 0.0
    speed: 50.0
  - projectile: projectiles/defaultbullet.yaml
    delay: 0.0
    position: [0.0, -8.0]
    direction: 0.0
    speed: 50.0
  - projectile: projectiles/defaultbullet.yaml
    delay: 0.02
    position: [-8.0, 8.0]
    direction: 0.1</pre>
</div>
<p>This weapon can fire 2 bursts, each taking 0.06 seconds, before reloading for
0.2 seconds. Each burst consists of 4 projectiles shot at different positions
(relative to the ship) in different directions (in radians, relative to the
ship).</p>
<p>Two of the projectiles are fired immediately, the other two 0.02 seconds
later. The projectiles fired immediately are fired at speed 50 and use their
engine component (defined in the projectile) to accelerate to full speed.
If speed is not specified, the projectiles are fired at their maximum speed.</p>
<p>Note that each projectile in the burst specifies its own projectile file. One
burst can consist of projectiles of multiple types. Each projectile is an
entity, just like a ship (in the engine, there is no difference between
projectiles and ships).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-projectile">
<h2>Creating a projectile<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-projectile" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Projectiles are found in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">projectiles</span></tt> subdirectory of the mod directory.</p>
<p>Internally, there is no difference between a projectile and a ship - both are
component based entities. Any component that can be used in a ship can be used
in a projectile, and vice versa.</p>
<p>To create a new projectile, you can create a file with the contents of the
following example in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">projectiles</span></tt> directory.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can try copying and modifying any projectile that already
exists there.</p>
<p>Example projectile:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>deathTimeout: 1.1
engine :
  maxSpeed       : 2000
  acceleration   : 1000  #-1 is instant
volume:
  aabbox:
    min: [-2, -12]
    max: [2,  0]
visual:   visual/defaultbullet.yaml
warhead:
  damage: 10</pre>
</div>
<p>Most components of this projectile are the same as components used in a ship.</p>
<p>The main differences are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>deathTimeout</em> component, which destroys the projectile 1.1 seconds after it&#8217;s
fired. It is important that projectiles that don&#8217;t collide with anything have
a limited lifetime so they don&#8217;t stay in memory forever.</li>
<li>There is no <em>collidable</em> component. This means the projectiles can&#8217;t collide
with other projectiles - only with collidable ships.</li>
<li>The warhead has no <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">killsEntity:</span> <span class="pre">false</span></tt>, so the projectile is &#8220;killed&#8221;
after it hits its target.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the projectile has no health or weapon. However, it could have health or
weapon, or any other component a ship can have. (For example, a collidable
projectile with limited health could be a missile that can be shot down).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-level">
<h2>Creating a level<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-level" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Levels are described in YAML files found in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">levels</span></tt> subdirectory of a mod
directory.</p>
<p>Currently, there&#8217;s only 1 level file, which the game is hardcoded to load:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">level1.yaml</span></tt>. This should be used for level development for now.</p>
<p>A level is composed of definitions of &#8220;waves&#8221; (groups of enemies
spawned simultaneously) and of a level script, which specifies when to
spawn a wave.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>wave wave1:
  spawn:
    - unit: ships/enemy1.yaml
      physics:
          position: [360, 32]
          rotation: 0
    - unit: ships/playership.yaml
      physics:
          position: [440, 64]
          rotation: 0
      dumbScript: dumbscripts/enemy1.yaml

level:
  !!pairs
  - effect lines:
      minWidth: 0.3
      maxWidth: 1.0
      minLength: 4.0
      maxLength: 16.0
      verticalScrollingSpeed: 300.0
      linesPerPixel: 0.001
      detailLevel: 7
      color: rgbaC8C8FF30
  - wait: 2.0
  - wave: wave1
  - wait: 5.0
  - text: Lorem Ipsum  #at top or bottom of screen
  - wait: 5.0
  - text: Level done!
  - wait: 2.0</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wave-definition">
<h3>Wave definition<a class="headerlink" href="#wave-definition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A wave definition starts with a mapping key named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wave</span> <span class="pre">xxx</span></tt> where xxx is the
name of the wave. Wave names <strong>must not contain spaces</strong> .</p>
<p>There can be any number of wave definitions, but two waves must not have
identical names.</p>
<p>Currently, the wave definition has one section, <em>spawn</em>, which is a
sequence of units (entities) to be spawned.</p>
<p>Each unit is a mapping with one required key, <em>unit</em>, which specifies filename
of the unit to spawn. The unit might contain more keys, which define components
to override components loaded from the unit definition.</p>
<p>In this example, the first unit has its physics component overridden, spawning
it at a particular position, and the second also overrides the <em>dumbScript</em>
component (explained below), specifying behavior of the spawned unit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="level-script">
<h3>Level script<a class="headerlink" href="#level-script" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The level script starts with a mapping key named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">level</span></tt>, and is composed of
pairs of instructions and their parameters.</p>
<p>This level is very simple. First, we start a &#8220;lines&#8221; effect that draws a
scrolling starfield background composed of randomly generated lines.
After 2 seconds, we spawn a single wave and later we display some text.
Once the script is done, the level ends (the player wins the level).
The player loses if their ship gets destroyed before the level is over.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-dumbscript">
<h2>Creating a DumbScript<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-dumbscript" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Normally when you spawn a unit, it just sits there and doesn&#8217;t do anything.</p>
<p>Behavior of an entity can be controlled by a <em>dumbScript</em> component, which
can be set in the entity YAML file or in a wave definition in a level.</p>
<p>DumbScript is a simple YAML based script that specifies actions the unit
should take. It&#8217;s called DumbScript because there is no flow control - it just
dumbly executes instructions one after another. In future, there might be
smarter scripts based on a real programming language, e.g. Lua.</p>
<p>DumbScripts are located in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dumbScripts</span></tt> subdirectory of a mod directory.</p>
<p>To create a new dumb script, you can create a file with the contents of the
following example in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dumbScripts</span></tt> directory.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can try copying and modifying any projectile that already
exists there.</p>
<p>Example DumbScript:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>!!pairs
- for 0.25:
    move-direction: 0.5
- for 0.5:
    move-direction: -0.5
- for 0.5:
    fire: [0, 1]
- for 0.5:
    move-direction: 0.5
    move-speed: 0.5
    fire: [0]
- for 0.5:
    move-direction: -0.5
    move-speed: 0.5
    fire: [0]
- for 5.0:
    move-direction: 0
- die:</pre>
</div>
<p>This script moves the entity in a direction of 0.5 radians for 0.25 seconds,
then in -0.5 radians for another 0.25 seconds, then it fires weapons 0 and 1
for 0.5 seconds, then moves, at half-speed, in a direction of 0.5 radians
while firing weapon 0, and then does the same moving in -0.5 radians.
In the end, it moves straight (0 radians) for 5 seconds, and kills the entity.</p>
<p>Note that DumbScripts can be used by any entity. If a dumbScript is in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dumbScripts/script.yaml</span></tt>, it will be used by an entity if you add the
following code to it:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>dumbScript: dumbScripts/script.yaml</pre>
</div>
<p>Similarly, it can be set in a wave definition in a level.
You can even use DumbScripts in projectiles. For example, you could use a
DumbScript to create a projectile that fires more projectiles (or one that
splits into multiple smaller projectiles).</p>
