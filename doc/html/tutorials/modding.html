<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To simplify its development and to make its engine reusable, ICE is designed to
be as moddable as possible. All entities in the game are loaded from human
readable YAML files. Graphics and &#8220;scripts&#8221; are also loaded from YAML, although
different formats might be supported in future.</p>
<div class="section" id="about-the-directory-structure">
<h3>About the directory structure<a class="headerlink" href="#about-the-directory-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ICE has a modular directory system to allow for pluggable mods in future.</p>
<p>Right now, there is only one &#8220;mod&#8221; - ICE itself. This mod can be found in the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">data/main</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">user_data/main</span></tt> directories.  Any file in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">data/main</span></tt>
can be overridden by a file in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">user_data/main</span></tt> with the same filename.</p>
<p>Note that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">user_data/main</span></tt> translates to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.ice/main</span></tt> after installation on
Linux and similar systems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-ship">
<h2>Creating a ship<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-ship" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ships are stored in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ships</span></tt> subdirectory of a mod directory. For the main
game, that is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">user_data/main/ships</span></tt>. This is a convention - ships could be
stored elsewhere if needed.</p>
<p>Ships are <em>entities</em> - collections of <em>components</em> that specify properties of
the ship. For example, a ship might have a <em>visual</em> component - which describes
how it is drawn.</p>
<p>To create your own ships, add a new file with contents of the following example
in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ships</span></tt> directory.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can try copying and modifying any ship that already exists
there.</p>
<p>Example ship:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>visual: visual/player.yaml
engine:
  maxSpeed: 300
  acceleration: 2100
volume:
  aabbox:
    min: [-32, -32]
    max: [32,  0]
weapon:
  0: weapons/player.yaml
collidable:
health: 500
warhead:
  damage: 500
  killsEntity: false</pre>
</div>
<p>Each item describes a component and its properties. This ship has the following
components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A <em>visual</em> component, pointing to the graphics file of the ship.</li>
<li>An <em>engine</em> component that can move the ship at most 300 units per second and
accelerate at 2100 units per second per second.</li>
<li>A <em>volume</em> used for collision detection (for example with projectiles).
This volume is an <em>aabbox</em> - axis-aligned-bounding-box, or a rectangle that does
not rotate.</li>
<li>A <em>weapon</em> component with one weapon at slot <em>0</em>. There are multiple (256)
slots to allow a ship to have more than one weapon.</li>
<li>A <em>collidable</em> component that allows the ship to receive collisions. Most
projectiles, for example, have a volume but are not collidable - they can&#8217;t
collide with each other, only with the <em>collidable</em> ships.</li>
<li>A <em>health</em> component with 500 maximum health. Entities with a health component
die when they run out of health.</li>
<li>A <em>warhead</em> component that causes 500 damage and doesn&#8217;t kill the ship itself.
Warheads are fired at collision with another entity. This means our ship
causes damage to other ships it collides with but doesn&#8217;t immediately get
destroyed. Most projectiles, for example, are destroyed as soon as they
collide with something.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other components a ship can have. You can see the modding reference
pages (linked from <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#index"><em>ICE documentation index</em></a>) more detailed information.</p>
<p>Importantly, a ship needs other resources - In this example, a visual component
and any weapons it may use. Those are explained below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-graphics-visual-component">
<h2>Creating graphics (visual component)<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-graphics-visual-component" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Currently the only graphics format supported by ICE is a simple YAML based
vector format that stores straight lines with variable colors and line widths.</p>
<p>Graphics are specified by <em>visual components</em>, defined in YAML files in the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">visual</span></tt> subdirectory of a mod directory.</p>
<p>To create your own visual component, you can create a file with the contents of
the following example in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">visual</span></tt> directory.</p>
<p>You could also try copying and modifying any visual component that already
exists there.</p>
<p>Example visual component:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>type: lines
vertices:
  !!pairs
  - width: 2
  - color:  rgba40400000
  - vertex: [-7.0, -4.0]
  - color:  rgbA0A0FF
  - vertex: [-1.0, 12.0]

  - vertex: [1.0,  12.0]
  - color:  rgba40400000
  - vertex: [7.0,  -4.0]

  - color:  rgbA0A0FF
  - vertex: [0.0,  8.0]
  - color:  rgba40400000
  - vertex: [0.0,  13.0]</pre>
</div>
<p>This visual component is a group of <em>lines</em>, currently the only supported
visual component <em>type</em>.</p>
<p>Lines are specified by the <em>vertices</em> tag, that allows setting line <em>width</em>,
vertex <em>color</em> and <em>vertex</em> itself.</p>
<p>Lines are formed by the 1st and 2nd vertex, the 3rd and 4rd, and so on.
The number of vertices must be even.</p>
<p>A <em>color</em> or <em>width</em> entry affects all vertices drawn after it, until the next
<em>color</em> or <em>width</em> entry. Default color is white and default width is 1.</p>
<p>Note that <em>width</em> affects only whole lines, while <em>color</em> can change colors of
each vertex (which blend in the line, so you can e.g. have a line that blends
from a red end to a blue end).</p>

<div class="section" id="creating-a-weapon">
<h2>Creating a weapon<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-weapon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Weapons are stored in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">weapons</span></tt> subdirectory of the mod directory. A
weapon fires <em>projectiles</em> (entities) in <em>bursts</em> of one or more projectiles.
Each burst takes time to be fired and consumes 1 unit of ammo (which may be
finite or infinite). When a weapon runs out of ammo, it can&#8217;t fire for a
specified <em>reload</em> period.</p>
<p>To create a new weapon, you can create a file with the contents of the
following example in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">weapons</span></tt> directory.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can copy and modify any weapon that already exists there.</p>
<p>Example weapon:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>burstPeriod: 0.06
ammo: 3
reloadTime: 0.2
burst:
 - entity: projectiles/defaultBullet.yaml
   delay: 0.0
   components:
     physics:
       position: [-1.0, 16.0]
       rotation: 0.5deg
       speed:    50.0
       spawnAbsolute: [velocity]
 - entity: projectiles/defaultBullet.yaml
   delay: 0.0
   components:
     physics:
       position: [1.0, 16.0]
       rotation: -0.5deg
       speed:    50.0
       spawnAbsolute: [velocity]
 - entity: projectiles/defaultBullet.yaml
   delay: 0.02
   components:
     physics:
       position: [-2.0, 12.0]
       rotation: 1deg
       speed:    50.0
       spawnAbsolute: [velocity]
 - entity: projectiles/defaultBullet.yaml
   delay: 0.02
   components:
     physics:
       position: [2.0, 12.0]
       rotation: -1deg
       speed:    50.0
       spawnAbsolute: [velocity]</pre>
</div>
<p>This weapon fires 3 bursts, each taking 0.06 seconds, before reloading for 0.2
seconds. Each burst consists of 4 projectiles shot at different positions
(relative to the ship) in different directions (specified in degrees here using
the <em>deg</em> suffix). Velocity of the fired (spawned) projectile is absolute,
determined by ship&#8217;s rotation and firing speed, unaffected by the ship&#8217;s
own movement.</p>
<p>Two projectiles are fired immediately, the other two 0.02 seconds later. The
projectiles are fired at speed 50 and use their engine component (defined in
the projectile) to accelerate to full speed.</p>
<p>Each projectile in the burst specifies its own entity file. One burst can
consist of projectiles of multiple types. Each projectile is an entity, just
like a ship. In fact a weapon could fire ships.</p>
<p>In the engine, there is no difference between projectiles and ships.  When
we&#8217;re firing the projectiles, we&#8217;re setting their positions by overriding their
physics components. Any component can be overridden by specifying it in
<em>components</em>. You can use this, for example, to change projectiles&#8217; visual
appeareance or give them specific behaviors by dumbScripts (described below).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-projectile">
<h2>Creating a projectile<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-projectile" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Projectiles are found in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">projectiles</span></tt> subdirectory of the mod directory.</p>
<p>Both projectiles and ships are component based entities. Any component that can
be used in a ship can be used in a projectile, and vice versa.</p>
<p>To create a new projectile, create a file with the contents of the
following example in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">projectiles</span></tt> directory.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could copy and modify any projectile that already exists
there.</p>
<p>Example projectile:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>deathTimeout: 1.1
engine :
  maxSpeed       : 2000
  acceleration   : 1000
volume:
  aabbox:
    min: [-2, -12]
    max: [2,  0]
visual:   visual/defaultbullet.yaml
warhead:
  damage: 10</pre>
</div>
<p>Most components of this projectile are the same as ones used in the ship
example.</p>
<p>The main differences are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>deathTimeout</em> component, which destroys the projectile 1.1 seconds after it&#8217;s
fired. It is important that projectiles that don&#8217;t collide with anything have
a limited lifetime so they don&#8217;t stay in memory forever.</li>
<li>There is no <em>collidable</em> component. This means the projectiles can&#8217;t collide
with other projectiles - only with collidable ships.</li>
<li>The warhead has no <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">killsEntity:</span> <span class="pre">false</span></tt>, so the projectile is &#8220;killed&#8221;
after it hits its target.</li>
</ul>
<p>This projectile has no health or weapons. However, it could have health or
weapons, or any other component a ship can have. (For example, a collidable
projectile with limited health could be a missile that can be shot down).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-level">
<h2>Creating a level<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-level" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Levels are described in YAML files found in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">levels</span></tt> subdirectory of a mod
directory.</p>
<p>Currently, levels are standalone - there are no campaigns. Each level file name
must be named in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">levels.yaml</span></tt> file, which specifies levels to use in an
in-game level browser.</p>
<p>A level is composed of definitions of &#8220;waves&#8221; (groups of enemies
spawned simultaneously) and of a level script, which specifies when to
spawn a wave.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>wave wave1:
  spawner:
    - entity: ships/enemy1.yaml

</div>
<div class="section" id="wave-definition">
<h3>Wave definition<a class="headerlink" href="#wave-definition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A wave definition starts with a mapping key named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wave</span> <span class="pre">xxx</span></tt> where xxx is the
name of the wave. Wave names <strong>must not contain spaces</strong> .</p>
<p>There can be any number of wave definitions, but no two waves can have
identical names.</p>
<p>A wave is an entity, and a wave definition defines that entity. Waves are
generally used to spawn units by setting the <em>spawner</em> component.  Spawner is
a sequence of entities(units) to be spawned.</p>
<p>Each entity is a mapping with one required key, <em>entity</em>, which specifies filename
of the entity to spawn. Optional <em>delay</em> specifies delay to spawn after the wave,
in seconds.</p>
<p>Components of the entity can be overridden by <em>components</em>. At least the
physics component should be set here to position the entity. The second entity
overrides the <em>dumbScript</em> component (explained below), specifying behavior of
the spawned unit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="level-script">
<h3>Level script<a class="headerlink" href="#level-script" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A level script starts with a mapping key named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">level</span></tt>, and is composed of
instructions and their parameters.</p>
<p>This level is very simple. First, we start a &#8220;lines&#8221; effect that draws
a scrolling starfield background composed of randomly generated lines.  After
2 seconds, we spawn a wave. We wait 2 more seconds, and spawn the same wave
using a different format, changing positions of its entities by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[50,</span> <span class="pre">150]</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Then we wait another 2 seconds and spawn the same wave again, demonstrating the
third wave instruction format. Here we make full use of the fact that a wave is
actually an entity, and can override any of its components.</p>
<p>Finally, we display some text.  Once the script is done, the level ends (the
player wins the level).  The player loses if their ship gets destroyed before
the level is over.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-dumbscript">
<h2>Creating a DumbScript<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-dumbscript" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Normally when an entity is spawned, it just sits there and doesn&#8217;t do anything.</p>
<p>Entity behavior can be controlled by a <em>dumbScript</em> component, which can be set
in the entity YAML file or anywhere the entity is spawned (e.g. a wave
definition in a level).</p>
<p>DumbScript is a simple YAML based &#8220;script&#8221; that specifies actions the unit
should take. It&#8217;s called DumbScript because there is no flow control - it just
dumbly executes instructions one after another. In future, there might be
smarter scripts based on a real programming language, e.g. Lua.</p>
<p>DumbScripts are located in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dumbScripts</span></tt> subdirectory of a mod directory.</p>
<p>To create a new dumb script, you can create a file with the contents of the
following example in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dumbScripts</span></tt> directory.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could copy and modify any dumb script that already exists
there.</p>
<p>Example DumbScript:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>!!pairs
- for 0.25:
    move-direction: 0.5
- for 0.5:
    move-direction: -0.5
- for 0.5:
    fire: [0, 1]
- for 0.5:
    move-direction: 0.5
    move-speed: 0.5
    fire: [0]
- for 0.5:
    move-direction: -0.5
    move-speed: 0.5
    fire: [0]
- for 5.0:
    move-direction: 0
- die:</pre>
</div>
<p>This script moves the entity in a direction of 0.5 radians for 0.25 seconds,
then in -0.5 radians for another 0.25 seconds, then it fires weapons 0 and 1
for 0.5 seconds, then moves, at half-speed, in a direction of 0.5 radians
while firing weapon 0, and then does the same moving in -0.5 radians.
In the end, it moves straight (0 radians) for 5 seconds, and kills the entity.</p>
<p>Note that DumbScripts can be used by any entity. If a dumbScript is in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dumbScripts/script.yaml</span></tt>, it will be used by an entity if you add the
following code to it:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>dumbScript: dumbScripts/script.yaml</pre>
</div>
<p>Similarly, it can be set in a wave definition in a level.  You can even use
DumbScripts in projectiles. For example, you could use a DumbScript to create
a projectile that moves in a complex fashion and even fires its own weapon.</p>
